# Thesis Review Summary

As we head into **Week 24**, our portfolio is purposefully concentrated in **three biotech catalyst plays**, each with an imminent **binary event**. This **“all or nothing”** approach was adopted to try to dramatically outperform in the final stretch of the experiment.

Below is a recap of each position’s **thesis, recent developments, and game plan**, reinforcing why we are holding through their catalysts.

## Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)

### Catalyst / Thesis
MIST’s novel nasal spray **etripamil** (brand: **CARDAMYST**) for treating **paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)** is awaiting FDA approval on **Dec 13, 2025**. Our thesis is that approval is **highly likely**.

Key points:
- Phase 3 data showed **statistically significant conversion to normal rhythm vs placebo**
- First **at-home, fast-acting therapy** for PSVT (patients currently often require ER visits)
- Prior 2021 CRL was due to **manufacturing issues**, which have since been resolved
- NDA accepted; **no AdCom required**
- Strong balance sheet: **$82M+ cash** (Q3) plus a **$75M approval milestone**, reducing financing risk

### Recent Developments
- Stock rallied into the **high $2s** (52-week high $2.77; closed $2.64 on Dec 4)
- Management tone: **“optimistic and excited”** ahead of PDUFA
- New AHA analyses showed **consistent efficacy across subgroups**
- Mentioned in updated **ACLS guidelines** as a potential future tool
- No safety issues or negative FDA signals publicly
- Analyst targets generally in the **mid-single digits**, well above current price

### Catalyst Outlook
We are **highly confident** in a positive outcome. Approval would be the **first new PSVT drug in decades**, transforming MIST into a commercial-stage company overnight.

#### Upside Scenario
- Expected move: **$3.50–$4.50** immediately (≈50–70% gain)
- From our **$1.75 entry**, this implies **~100%+ return**
- Aggressive analysts cite **$6–$7** over 12 months

#### Downside Scenario
- Surprise CRL could drop stock **50–60%** toward ~$1
- ~$1.50/share in cash provides a backstop
- **Stop-loss at $1.60** limits downside to a small loss (~$0.15/share)

### Plan
- **Hold through FDA decision**
- Sell most or all shares into post-approval rally
- If rejected, stop-loss caps losses

### Thesis Confidence
**Very High.** Strong data, clear unmet need, resolved prior issues, and milestone financing suggest high approval odds. This is our **top conviction play**.

## VistaGen Therapeutics (VTGN)

### Catalyst / Thesis
VTGN is awaiting **Phase 3 (PALISADE-3)** results for **fasedienol (PH94B)** in **Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)**.

Key points:
- Trial redesigned to fix placebo issues from prior failed Phase 3
- Uses more realistic public-speaking challenge and stricter enrollment
- Potential **first fast-acting, as-needed SAD treatment**
- Large unmet market; current options are SSRIs or off-label benzos
- Data expected **by end of 2025**

### Recent Developments
- Management confirmed topline data timing and **NDA target mid-2026** if successful
- **$77.2M cash** (as of 9/30/25), sufficient to reach NDA
- Stock up ~20% in two weeks (**mid-$3s to ~$4.30–$4.40**)
- Rising volume (~1M shares/day vs ~0.6M previously)
- Added board member with FDA approval experience (**Paul Edick**)
- No safety issues or delays reported

### Catalyst Outlook
We assign **~50/50 probability**. CNS trials are difficult, but the **risk/reward is highly asymmetric**.

#### Upside Scenario
- Potential move to **$8–$10/share**
- At $8, market cap would still be only ~$350–$400M
- Some analysts could revive **teen-level targets**
- Plan to sell in stages to capture euphoria and follow-through

#### Downside Scenario
- Failure likely drops stock to **$2–$3**
- Cash value (~$1.95/share) provides partial floor
- **Stop-loss at $3.20** limits loss to ~10–15%

### Plan
- **Hold through data**
- If positive: sell ~50% on initial surge, trail stop on remainder
- If negative: stop-loss triggers, exit fully

### Thesis Confidence
**High.** While risky, trial redesign and management confidence justify the bet. Upside multiples far outweigh downside.

## SELLAS Life Sciences (SLS)

### Catalyst / Thesis
SLS is our **moonshot**: Phase 3 **REGAL** trial of **galinpepimut-S (GPS)** cancer vaccine in **AML second remission**.

Key points:
- Cancer vaccines historically have low success rates
- Interim analysis did **not stop for futility**
- Success would be transformative, validating a platform
- Additional asset: **CDK9 inhibitor SLS009**

Estimated probability: **~10–20%**, but with massive upside.

### Recent Developments
- Cash position strengthened to **~$73M total**
- Virtual R&D Day featured enthusiastic KOL commentary
- Positive Phase 2 data for **SLS009** presented at ASH
- Stock rose from ~$1.40 to ~$1.74 with heavy volume
- Increased speculation but also risk of “sell-the-news”

### Catalyst Outlook
A classic **low-probability, high-impact** event.

#### Upside Scenario
- Success could drive stock to **$4–$5+** (2–3x)
- $500–$600M valuation plausible on Phase 3 success
- Plan to sell most shares quickly; possibly retain a small runner

#### Downside Scenario
- Failure could drop shares **50%+** to ~$0.70–$0.90
- **Stop at $1.10**, though gap risk exists
- Absolute loss limited due to small position size

### Plan
- **Hold through readout**
- Treat as a lottery-style position
- Exit quickly on success; stop-loss on failure
- No doubling down if trial fails

### Thesis Confidence
**Moderate.** We are realistic about the odds. Encouraging signals exist, but history is against cancer vaccines. Small sizing makes the risk acceptable.

## Big Picture – Portfolio-Level Thesis

We intentionally pivoted to a **concentrated, catalyst-driven strategy** to attempt a late-stage catch-up to the S&P 500.

### Rationale
- Catalysts are **uncorrelated** (cardiology, psychiatry, oncology)
- Binary biotech wins can **double or triple overnight**
- Risk managed via **position sizing and stop-losses**
- Needed **multi-bagger potential** given time constraints

### Portfolio Outcome Scenarios
- **One win**: materially narrows performance gap
- **Two wins**: potential to outperform the S&P 500
- **Three wins**: grand slam outcome
- **Zero wins**: portfolio underperforms, but survives (~$50–$60 end value)

We intentionally avoided hedging to **preserve upside**, accepting volatility as the cost.

---

## Summary

Our portfolio thesis is simple but aggressive:

> **Concentrate risk into a few uncorrelated, high-impact biotech catalysts, manage downside with stops, and let upside run.**

This approach gives us a **fighting chance for dramatic outperformance**, fully acknowledging the volatility and risk involved.

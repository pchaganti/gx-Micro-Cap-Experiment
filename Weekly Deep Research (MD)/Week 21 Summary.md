# Thesis Review Summary

In conclusion, our portfolio is now streamlined to three high-conviction, catalyst-driven biotechs, each
poised for a potentially game-changing event in the coming weeks. This concentrated strategy is intentional –
we’re swinging for an outsized finish to close the performance gap with the S&P 500 by year-end. Below is
a brief recap of each position’s thesis and the rationale behind our moves:

## Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)

We continue to back MIST as our FDA approval play. The thesis remains that etripamil nasal spray will likely
win FDA approval by the Dec 13 PDUFA date, given strong clinical data and resolved manufacturing issues.
If approved, MIST could double or more (analysts target ~$3.75, nearly +88% upside). Our confidence is
reinforced by the company’s preparedness (funding and launch plans in place) and the significant unmet need
in PSVT (first at-home treatment). We are holding through the decision, as the risk-reward is extremely favorable.

A successful approval should dramatically boost our portfolio (MIST is ~40% weight now), while a failure,
though damaging, is something we’ve mitigated with a stop and by not over-weighting beyond our original stake.

**Thesis:** High probability of FDA approval unlocking substantial value.

## VistaGen Therapeutics (VTGN)

The thesis for VTGN is unchanged: it’s a binary Phase 3 catalyst in CNS that offers a second shot at a big win.
Fasedienol’s Phase 3 readout for acute treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder is expected by end of Q4. We believe
changes made after earlier trials (which were confounded by placebo effects) give this new trial a real chance
of success. VistaGen’s strong cash position means even in a downside scenario, it survives to regroup (limiting
total downside).

Upside on success could easily be +100% or more, as a positive result would revive the program’s value and
could attract partners or acquirers. Holding VTGN diversifies our risk – it’s uncorrelated with MIST’s outcome –
and provides another potential catalyst to propel our portfolio upward.

**Thesis:** Redesigned Phase 3 could surprise to the upside; any success would be a pivotal turnaround for the stock.

## Sellas Life Sciences (SLS)

Our new addition’s thesis is a classic high-reward oncology gamble: SLS’s Phase 3 REGAL trial in AML is nearing
its final analysis (anticipated imminently). The therapy (GPS vaccine) targets a hard-to-treat scenario (maintaining
remission in AML), and if it significantly extends survival, Sellas could become a very valuable company overnight.

We were impressed by the interim data monitoring outcome (no safety issues, continue trial), which suggests no
early futility. Insiders and KOLs also showed optimism at a recent R&D day. By investing in SLS, we’ve added a third
independent catalyst: success here does not depend on broader market conditions or on our other stocks’ success.
It simply hinges on trial results.

The risk is high – a negative outcome could cut the stock in half (or worse temporarily). However, the company’s
~$73M cash position provides cushion and potential for recovery even if the trial fails (they have other programs).
We sized SLS reasonably (~27% of the portfolio) so no single outcome can make or break us, but it can contribute
significantly.

**Thesis:** Binary event with asymmetrical upside; a bet that Sellas’s immunotherapy will show a survival benefit
in AML, potentially re-rating the stock substantially.

## Aytu BioPharma (AYTU) – Exited

We decided to fully exit AYTU this week, converting it to cash for the SLS purchase. The thesis for AYTU (an
undervalued commercial-stage pharma with a novel antidepressant) is still valid long-term, but mismatched to our
timeframe. Exxua’s launch will take a few quarters to show in earnings, and any stock appreciation will likely be
gradual.

With only ~5 weeks left in our experiment, we redirected capital to immediate catalysts. Our small profit on AYTU
indicates stabilization, but we traded stability for higher potential returns. This raises risk, as we no longer have a
steady position, but one or two big wins from MIST/VTGN/SLS can far outweigh AYTU’s expected near-term gains.

**Summary of rationale:** We let go of AYTU’s modest prospects to double down on catalyst-driven alpha.

## Next Week Outlook

Going into Week 22, our portfolio is entirely catalyst-centric. Performance will be quiet until news hits, but when it
hits, it could be dramatic. This strategy introduces significant volatility – any single failure could hurt the portfolio
in the short term. However, a single success could more than make up for it, and multiple successes would be
spectacular.

We’ve essentially positioned the portfolio with multiple “lottery tickets” backed by data-driven rationale, not pure
speculation. Stops and diversification help control risk in this high-stakes approach.

## Summary

By concentrating on three independent biotech catalysts (MIST FDA approval, VTGN Phase 3 results, SLS Phase 3
results), we maximize the probability of a significant positive event in the coming weeks. Each stock carries the
potential for large upside (doubling or more) on good news.

We have taken steps to limit downside (stops, reasonable sizing, choosing companies with cash buffers). This
focused, catalyst-driven plan aligns with our mandate to optimize risk-adjusted return – now tilted more toward
“return” given our performance gap.

## Thesis Summary

We’ve repositioned for an “all or nothing” finale: either our research pays off with one or more big wins, or we fall
short knowing we gave the portfolio the best possible chance at a comeback. MIST’s regulatory outcome, VTGN’s
trial redemption, and SLS’s oncology breakthrough each have game-changing potential. We will execute with
discipline and adapt as news develops. The coming weeks will be decisive, and we are prepared for the range of
outcomes.

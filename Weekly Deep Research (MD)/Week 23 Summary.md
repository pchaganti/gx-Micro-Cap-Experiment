# Thesis Review Summary

As we head into Week 24, our portfolio remains an all-or-nothing biotech catalyst play. Below is a brief recap of each position’s thesis, recent developments, and our confidence level, which reinforces why we are sticking to this strategy:

---

## Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)

**Thesis:**  
MIST’s nasal spray (etripamil) for PSVT has a high likelihood of FDA approval on Dec 13. The Phase 3 efficacy was strong (significantly higher conversion to normal heart rhythm vs placebo), and manufacturing issues from the prior CRL have been resolved. The company’s tone is optimistic, and importantly they secured non-dilutive funding (a $75M milestone payment upon approval), which means they can launch without an imminent cash crunch.

**Recent Update:**  
The stock has climbed into the high-$2s as the decision nears, indicating investor anticipation. No negative signals emerged in our research – if anything, the Q3 update bolstered confidence (management “excited” for the PDUFA).

**Catalyst Outlook:**  
We are *highly confident* in approval. The unmet need (at-home PSVT treatment) and clean data support it.

- **Upside:** Estimated stock move to **$3.50–$4.50** on approval (analyst avg target $6+).  
- **Downside:** Rejection could halve the stock or worse; however, our stop and ~$1.50/share cash on hand provide some backstop.

**Plan:**  
Hold through the decision. If approval, sell most/all into the post-news rally (~100% gain from entry). If rejection, rely on stop-loss.

**Thesis Confidence:** **Very high** – top play; favorable risk/reward.

## VistaGen Therapeutics (VTGN)

**Thesis:**  
VTGN is attempting a comeback with its Phase 3 PALISADE-3 trial for acute treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder. After a prior Phase 3 failed in 2022 due to placebo issues, VTGN redesigned the trial using a public-speaking challenge and stricter enrollment to reduce placebo responders. This gives PALISADE-3 a fair shot at success.

If positive, fasedienol becomes the first fast-acting therapy for social anxiety – a huge market. The stock could double or more.

**Recent Update:**  
Management reiterated data by end of 2025 and discussed NDA plans for mid-2026. They have **~$77M cash**, enough to reach NDA. Stock rising ~20% recently to ~$4.90, possibly signaling optimism/speculation.

**Catalyst Outlook:**  
We assign a **~50/50 chance of success**.

- **Upside:** Estimated **$8–$10**.  
- **Downside:** Failure could mean ~$2 or lower; stop-loss triggers around $3.20.

**Plan:**  
Hold through data. Use stop-loss if it fails. On success, sell half on spike, and half with trailing stop.

**Thesis Confidence:** **High** – binary, but improved design + confident management = worthwhile gamble.

## SELLAS Life Sciences (SLS)

**Thesis:**  
SLS is the moonshot. GPS (cancer vaccine) in the Phase 3 REGAL trial seeks to show overall survival benefit in AML – very ambitious, historically low odds. But interim analysis did **not** halt for futility, suggesting data weren’t terrible.

If successful, the stock could **explode** (to $4–$5+, from ~$1.60). A win would validate GPS and boost SLS009 (CDK9 inhibitor with positive Phase 2 data at ASH).

**Recent Update:**  
SLS raised substantial cash via warrants, ending Q3 with **~$73M**. Even if REGAL fails, the company can pivot; stock may not collapse to pennies. Recent R&D day had KOL “genuine enthusiasm.” Stock uptick indicates some positioning ahead of data.

**Catalyst Outlook:**  
Low probability, very high payoff.

- **Upside:** 2–3x or more.  
- **Downside:** 50%+ loss (softened by cash + stop-loss).

**Plan:**  
Hold through outcome (imminent). If good, sell most quickly. Possibly keep a tiny lotto piece. If bad, stop-loss manages damage.

**Thesis Confidence:** **Moderate** – hopeful but realistic. No red flags in research.

# Big Picture (Portfolio-Level Thesis)

The portfolio is intentionally concentrated in **three independent biotech catalysts**. This pivot was deliberate to attempt a comeback vs the benchmark.

By betting on three uncorrelated binary events:

- **One win** can narrow the gap.  
- **Two wins** could potentially beat the S&P outright.

Trade-off = high volatility & drawdown risk (~50% max drawdown so far).  
But we control risk through stops and sizing. While not hedged, diversification exists via independent catalysts.

We’ve positioned for **multi-bagger potential** while limiting catastrophic downside. No hedges were added because they’d dilute upside.

We now enter the most exciting (and nerve-wracking) phase:

- **MIST** – crown jewel; highest probability.  
- **VTGN** – logical rebound with asymmetric upside.  
- **SLS** – high-risk moonshot with multi-bagger potential.

We have clear plans for all outcomes. The next week or two likely determine the final experiment outcome.

# Confirm Cash and Constraints

**Cash Utilization:**  
After implementing orders, cash is **$0.85**. Fully invested. No new cash used. All planned transactions use existing capital only.

**Compliance with Trading Rules:**

1. **No leverage or shorts** – only long equity.  
2. All holdings are **U.S. micro-caps < $300M** (MIST ~$273M; VTGN ~$190M; SLS ~$231M).  
3. **Full shares only**; all orders are integers.  
4. **Liquidity safe** – trades are tiny vs ADV.  
5. **Risk controls** – stop-loss orders in place; no breaches.  
6. **Execution policy** – standard limit/stop behavior, DAY for discretionary, GTC for stops.  
7. **Cadence** – research and planning performed for this week; mid-week actions limited to reacting to catalysts per preset plans.

**Final Portfolio Snapshot (Week 24):**

- **14 MIST**  
- **6 VTGN**  
- **13 SLS**  
- **$0.85 cash**

All constraints satisfied. We are now in “wait for catalysts” mode with risk controls active.

We will adhere to the plan strictly. Any deviation will be justified. Portfolio is primed for the catalyst outcomes.
